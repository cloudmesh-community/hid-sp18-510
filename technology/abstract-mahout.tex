\section{Apache Mahout}

Apache Mahout, an Apache Software Foundation project, is a distributed linear algebra framework and mathematically expressive Scala DSL designed to aid mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists in implementing their own algorithms~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-Mahout}. The project was initially driven by Ng et al.'s paper ``Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ng-Mahout}and has since evolved to cover much broader machine-learning approaches~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ibm-Mahout}. While Apache Spark is recommended back end and core algorithms are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop, it can be extended to other back ends and standalone implementations as well. Apache mahoutâ€™s core algorithms primarily contain implementations for clustering, classification, and Collaborative filtering~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout}.
