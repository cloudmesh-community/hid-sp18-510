\section{Apache Mahout}

Apache Mahout, an Apache Software Foundation project, is a distributed linear algebra framework and mathematically expressive Scala DSL designed to aid mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists in implementing their own algorithms~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-Mahout}. Initiated based on Andrew Ng et al.'s paper ``Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ng-Mahout}, it has evolved over time to cover other general machine-learning approaches~\cite{hid-sp18-510-ibm-Mahout}. While Apache Spark is recommended back end, where core algorithms are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop, Mahout is also extensible to other back ends and standalone implementations~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout}. ``Apache mahoutâ€™s core algorithms primarily contain implementations for clustering, classification, and Collaborative filtering''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Mahout}.
