\section Theano

Theano is a numerical computation library for Python. In Theano, computations are expressed using a NumPy syntax and compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures. Theano is an open source project, primarily developed by a machine learning group at the Université de Montréal. \cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-theano}. Theano is a Python library that allows developers to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Some of the features of Theano include tight integration with NumPy, transparent use of a GPU to perform data intensive computations, dynamic C code generation for evaluation expressions faster and support for extensive unit testing and self-verification \cite{hid-sp18-510-web-theano}.
