\section{Kubernetes}

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot, and is the root of governor and cybernetic. Kubernetes can schedule and run application containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines. However, Kubernetes also allows developers to ‘cut the cord’ to physical and virtual machines, moving from a host-centric infrastructure to a container-centric infrastructure, which provides the full advantages and benefits inherent to containers~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-Kubernetes}. Kubernetes defines a set of building blocks (``primitives'') which collectively provide mechanisms for deploying, maintaining, and scaling applications. The components which make up Kubernetes are designed to be loosely coupled and extensible so that it can meet a wide variety of different workloads~\cite{hid-sp18-510-wiki-Kubernetes}.
