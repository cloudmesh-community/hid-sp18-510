\section{Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit}

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source toolkit for commercial-grade distributed deep learning. CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs). CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers~\cite{hid-sp18-510-web-cntk}. ``CNTK currently supports Windows and Linux platforms. CNTK also supports the description of neural networks via C++, Network Definition Language (NDL) and other descriptive languages such as Python and C\#''~\cite{hid-sp18-510-kd-cntk}.
